# Paste

This is a simple Paste application I created using the Silex micro-framework and Symfony Components.

I never got around to finishing it off, as it was only ever meant to be a quick project to get myself used to Silex. Unit tests, comments and a working contact form are all missing. If I get chance in the future I will finish it off and package it up for better distribution.

## Demo

You can see it working at http://paste.adamboxall.com. A few friends from the PHPFreaks #help IRC channel use it occasionally when helping people, but I've never tried to properly promote it.
